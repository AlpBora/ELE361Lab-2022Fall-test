# Welcome to ELE361L & github :octocat:

In this course we will be using Github Classroom to manage course files & assignments. So it is important you feel familiar to using it. Look for any resource around web to learn some common Github terms like repository, commit, push, branch, markdown, etc. You can begin from having a look at Github's documentation.

# Your First Task

Your first task is quite easy. **Create** a new markdown file named "**PreLab2.md**". Then **edit** this file so that it has **H1 heading** titled "**Week-2 PreLab**", and it contains your PC's **system properties** like **processor info**, **RAM**, **operating system version**. You can use system properties if you are on a Windows machine to obtain tihs info. Here are my settings:
```
Processor	Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-1005G1 CPU @ 1.20GHz   1.19 GHz
Installed RAM	8.00 GB (7.80 GB usable)
Edition	Windows 10 Education
Version	21H2
```

Complete your task accordingly using 
* **Github interface** or 
* cloning the repo to your local PC first then commit your changes and lastly push it if you know how to use **Git**.
